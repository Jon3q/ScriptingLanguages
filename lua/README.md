Here is my Tetris project created with LÖVE framework.

The extra features are:
- keeping your in-game score
- showing the next piece that is gonna appear on the top of your screen

To run this simply download LÖVE, copy this repo and while in it's localization run love ./
Or you can just drag the game directory to love.exe file.

Remember to have fun
