This project contains a working tictactoe game, that you can play with other player or with a computer.
To play the game just clone this repo, run it and have fun :)

After running it should look like this:

After each turn you're able to save the game and evertime you're in the main menu you can load last save.
Best feature is that it handles which turn it was when you saved the game.

Have fun!
